# another hack. Do not include the Kirigami resources (on static build). It causes
# double defined symbols in our setting. I would like a nicer fix for this
# issue, but failed to find one. For example, not adding the resource in
# our build causes the qrc file not to be generated. Manual generation
# of the resource file (using rcc) introduces the double symbols again. 
# so it seems some Kirigami weirdness (but their staticcmake example compiles
# correctly).
